# Computational Macroeconomics

These are my course materials for a graduate course on Computational Macroeconomics taught at the University of Tübingen.
The compiled materials (such as PDFs) are available under [Releases](https://github.com/wmutschl/Computational-Macroeconomics/releases).

Please feel free to use this for teaching or learning purposes; however, taking into account the [GPL 3.0 license](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/).

## Content
We cover modern theoretical macroeconomics (the study of aggregated variables such as economic growth, unemployment and inflation by means of structural macroeconomic models) and combine it with numerical methods to study abstract macroeconomic concepts such as optimal monetary, fiscal and environmental policy,  occasionally binding constraints (zero-lower-bound, irreversible investment), quantitative easing and rare disasters. To this end, we use the Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) model paradigm, particularly focusing on different variants of the New-Keynesian model, and develop the numerical procedures and algorithms required to solve and simulate such models. Using several examples from the literature the theoretical and methodological foundations of computational macroeconomics are taught.

As Computational Macroeconomics is highly computational, the course is interactive and *hands-on*, so there is no formal separation between the lecture and the exercise class. Each topic begins with a theoretical input and presentation of methods. These concepts are practiced directly thereafter by means of exercises and implemented on the computer in [MATLAB](https://mathworks.com)/[Octave](https://octave.org) and [Dynare](https://www.dynare.org).

## Learning target

Students acquire knowledge of advanced numerical methods in the field of computational macroeconomics. This knowledge is relevant for the realization of a wide variety of macroeconomic research projects and is applied in central banks, ministries, research institutes (e.g. DIW, ifo, IfW, IWH, RWI) and research departments of international organizations (e.g. IMF, World Bank). Upon successful  completion of this module, students are prepared to work in these areas. At the same time, the module  prepares students for the requirements of a methodologically oriented macroeconomic dissertation.

Students get familiar with a variety of algorithms, examples and situations in which computational thinking is useful in approximating and evaluating abstract macroeconomic phenomena. They recognize and appreciate the connections between theory and computational methods and use their training to find possible avenues of research. While constructing abstract algorithms, they identify appropriate computational tools and evaluate their strengths and weaknesses in the context of problem solving. They utilize computers and software effectively as tools for solving and simulating macroeconomic models. In addition, because students work on the problem sets as a team, students' coordination, organization, and communication skills are enhanced.


## Requirements
Basic undergraduate knowledge of macroeconomics as well as econometrics are required, programming skills in a scripting language are advantageous, but not necessary.

## Software used

* [MATLAB](https://mathworks.com) or [Octave](https://octave.org)
* [Dynare](https://www.dynare.org)


## Getting Involved
If you spot mistakes, let me know by opening an issue or write me an email to [willi@mutschler.eu](mailto:willi@mutschler.eu).
Moreover, solutions to the exercises in other computer languages (e.g. Julia, Python or R) are highly appreciated.
